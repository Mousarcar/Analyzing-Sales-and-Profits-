# Analyzing Sales and Profits
## Introduction
This project involves analyzing a sales
dataset with two main parts. The first
part includes details about each sale,
such as the Sales Person, Geography,
Product, Amount, and Units sold. The
second part shows the Cost per Unit for
each product. By combining these
datasets, we can better understand sales
performance, profitability, and trends by
location.
## Problem Statement
This project aims to analyze sales data to understand key trends and
insights. We will examine overall statistics, explore data with cross filtering, identify sales by country, determine the top products by revenue
per unit, spot anomalies, find the best sales persons by country, calculate
profits by product, create a dynamic sales report by country, and identify
the products for discontinuation.
